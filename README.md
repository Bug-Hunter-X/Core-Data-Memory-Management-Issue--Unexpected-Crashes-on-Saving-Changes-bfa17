# Core Data Memory Management Issue in Objective-C

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Objective-C Core Data development: unexpected crashes or data inconsistencies when saving changes to fetched objects due to improper memory management. The bug arises from incorrectly handling the lifecycle of fetched managed objects, leading to context errors when attempting to save changes.

## Bug Description

The `CoreDataBug.m` file contains code that fetches managed objects, modifies them, and then attempts to save changes to the Core Data context. However, the fetched objects are not properly managed, resulting in crashes or data inconsistencies.

## Solution

The `CoreDataBugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version of the code. The solution involves carefully managing the lifecycle of the fetched managed objects, ensuring that they are released appropriately to prevent context errors.  This includes using proper techniques for handling NSFetchedResultsController and ensuring the context remains valid throughout the object's lifespan.  See detailed comments within the solution code for specific fixes.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Build and run the project. Note that the buggy version may crash or fail to save changes consistently.
3. Compare the `CoreDataBug.m` and `CoreDataBugSolution.m` files to understand the differences and the fix.
